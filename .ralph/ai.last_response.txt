  "analysis": "Criteria 1 (ECS stable) and 3 (no FATAL errors) pass. However, criterion 2 is definitively unmet — CloudWatch returned zero [ModelService] events, meaning Bedrock routing is unverified. Criterion 4 (tests) has truncated output with no exit code or pass/fail summary captured. Criterion 5 (DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md) was written multiple times but its final contents were never shown, so correctness is unverifiable. Remediation steps 7-14 all returned opaque 'ok' strings with no substantive data, indicating the retry logic failed to capture meaningful output.",
  "issues": [
    "Criterion 2 FAILED: [ModelService] never appeared in CloudWatch logs. Bedrock routing cannot be confirmed end-to-end. No alternative log queries (raw log stream fetch, broader filter patterns) produced actionable results.",
    "Criterion 4 INCONCLUSIVE: Test output was truncated at the migration log line. No Jest summary (pass/fail counts) or exit code was ever captured despite multiple attempts.",
    "Criterion 5 UNVERIFIABLE: DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md was rewritten 3 times (steps 6, 10, 14) but its final contents were never read back and shown. Cannot confirm it contains date, git SHA, Bedrock status, and errors.",
    "DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md should report Bedrock status as 'unverified' (not 'working') since the required positive evidence ([ModelService] logs) was never found.",
    "Steps 7-14 all returned 'ok' with zero diagnostic data — the remediation loop did not meaningfully advance the verification."
